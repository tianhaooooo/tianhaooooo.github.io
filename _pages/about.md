I am a second-year Ph.D. student in the Min H. Kao Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at [The University of Tennessee, Knoxville](https://www.utk.edu/). I am a member of the [MoSIS Lab](https://mosis.eecs.utk.edu/members.html), under the supervision of [Dr. Jian Liu](https://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jliu/).

My research interests are Mobile sensing, LLMs (Large Language Models), and AI for smart fitness and health monitoring.
